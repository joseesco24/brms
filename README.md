# dummy_enterprises_process_management_system
My first attempt to create an enterprise architecture that left all the business logic in charge to enterprise systems, the idea is to use a BPMS and a BRMS as the main systems, but the architecture is also going to integrate a ERP. All the architecture is going to be implemented in Docker for this exercise.
