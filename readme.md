# Dummy Enterprises Process Management System

My first attempt to create an enterprise architecture that left all the business logic in charge to enterprise systems, the idea is to use a BPMS and a BRMS as the main systems, but the architecture is also going to integrate a ERP and maybe in the future some custom developments. All the architecture is going to be implemented in Docker for this exercise.
